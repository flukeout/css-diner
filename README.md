### Filing issues and PRs

Please file issues and PRs in the [css-diner repo](https://github.com/flukeout/css-diner/).

### Repo structure

Here's the repo structure, it's a bit confusing...

* Currently, all of the working code (including issues, PRs and in-progress branches) is hosted in the [css-diner repo](https://github.com/flukeout/css-diner/)
  * The latest version of the code is on the ``develop`` branch
* The live version is published from the [flukeout.github.io repo](https://github.com/flukeout/flukeout.github.io/issues)
  * Live version lives on the ``master`` branch

### Deploying

This is more of a note to myself in case I forget, to deploy the latest version, I'll have to push to the ``master`` branch on the ``flukeout.github.io`` repo from the latest ``develop`` branch.

# Roadmap and Status

**Potential Features & Improvements**

* Lots of people have trouble with level 19, how should I address this?
* Create levels for attribute selectors
  * Will probably add attributes like ``customer='bob'`` and place a little nametag by those dishes
  * Also some great ideas in [this issue](https://github.com/flukeout/css-diner/issues/91)
* Figure out how to tackle the ``.table`` element
  * Including it in the selector string makes the selectors invalid, but it shouldn't
* Investigate the order of stacked oranges in the markup, some users think it's counter intuitive
* Block attempts to use comma between selectors
* Only pass each level if that level's selector is used
* Make it easier to navigate between levels
* Number all of the levels in the menu
* Add UI to Tweet about finishing all of the levels
* Add additional challenges per Selector
  * Some repetition per level would be good
